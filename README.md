# A component based form in React using Formik and Yup for validation

I needed to learn how to use Formik and Yup as packages to build a React form with built-in validation.  The react-datepicker package is used for date fields.

All fields have form validation that blocks submission until fields are properly filled in.  Error messages appear on screen in red when erroneous/imcomplete submission is attempted.

## Screenshot

Form shown displaying red messages in response to a user attempting to skip a form field.  Other messages appear if/when fields are used, but data entered is not adequate or in proper form.  Submission is blocked until fields are fully/correctly populated.
